However, Pullulan can also be absorbed by the skin and reach the dermis. Its absorption and the reaching of the dermis is promoted by 3 enhancers, belonging to the Patent on Labo Skin Technology No. 711 466, namely Pentylene Glycol, Decylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol. The Absorption Test conducted by means of Franz Cells (Report E. Ex07-MS04 2016/1896 dated 28/07/2016) showed an overall absorption percentage of Pullulan, in both epidermis and dermis, equal to 70.5%. The portion of Pullulan that reaches the dermis binds to dermal collagen forming a supporting scaffold that restores tissues’ firmness and compactness for a long time. This is the “”mechanical”” effect in the medium and long term, which is added to the medium and long term effect performed by the molecules playing a dermo-cosmetic “”biological”” activity, that work synergistically on the structures of the dermis (Glycine, Proline, Alanine; Tripeptide-10 Citrulline; DMAE; 3-Aminopropane Sulfonic Acid; Acetyl Tetrapeptide-2)."
