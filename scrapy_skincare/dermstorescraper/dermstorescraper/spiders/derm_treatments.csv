                          Red 633nm and near-infrared 830nm are the most clinically-proven wavelengths for skin health and rejuvenation, with 830nm achieving the quickest results and client satisfaction.
                          Shorter wavelengths such as green, yellow and purple penetrate poorly and are absorbed by melanin and superficial blood. They will not reach the dermis where the main cells for healing and rejuvenation are located, and therefore will not stimulate the production of collagen and elastin. 
                          Longer wavelengths such as red 633nm and near-infrared 830nm penetrate well into the skin and reach the dermis – not only do they stimulate collagen and elastin production (rejuvenating the complexion), they also penetrate deep into the body, reaching muscles, nerves and bone, increasing blood flow and targeting inflammation whilst supporting cellular regrowth and regeneration to help reduce pain and heal injuries."

Not bad for a tiny jar.",56.0,,,,"Key Ingredients:

                          Acetyl Hexapeptide-8: Also known as Argireline and acetyl hexapeptide-3, this neurotransmitter-inhibiting peptide targets expression wrinkles similar to the way Botox does. This peptide has the ability to significantly decrease wrinkle depth and width while increasing moisturization.

                          4% Dipeptide Diaminobutyroyl Benzylamide Diacetate (Syn-Ake): This synthetic tripeptide's small molecular weight allows it to penetrate skin easily. A triple amino acid complex targets wrinkles caused by facial movement (again, similar to Botox).

                          2% Copper Lysinate/Prolinate (Neodermyl®): An essential amino acid- mineral complex shown to boost the skin’s own collagen and elastin production. Neodermyl is a pure source of bio-energy, allowing it to naturally diffuse into skin to re-energize senescent fibroblasts and trigger production of collagen and elastin.

                          Mango Seed Butter: A fatty acid-rich plant-based emollient and a key vehicle for buttery, skin-soothing hydration in our formula.

                          Lupinus Albus (White Lupine) Seed Oil: A non-fragrant plant oil containing a powerful trio of omegas 3, 6, and 9. These unsaturated fatty acids keep skin well-moisturized, strengthened, and calm.

                          Poria Cocos Extract: This mushroom-derived extract has antioxidant and skin-soothing powers.

                          Nephelium Lappaceum Peel Extract: This extract is derived from the outer layers of the rambutan fruit, a tree native to Southeast Asia. The outer peel of the fruit is rich in antioxidants and polyphenol compounds, which help protect and strengthen the skin barrier from oxidative stress.

                          3% Hedychium Coronarium Root Extract: This extract from Hawaiian white ginger (or butterfly ginger) acts as a multiprotector for skin exposed to blue light, UV, and environmental pollution.

                          2% Ziziphus Spina-Christi Leaf: The leaves from Christ's thorn plant are used to create an extract (professionally known as GlowAGETM), which is proven to improve wrinkle depth and volume, smooth the eye area, and reduce collagen fragmentation in this concentration.

                          1% Argania Spinosa Callus Culture Extract: This plant stem cell derivative (also known as PhytoCellTecTM) comes from the argan tree and has proven capabilities for dermal stem cell protection, improving skin firmness and tightness, and anti-wrinkle effects on fine lines.

                          1% Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract: This extract contains saponins, which can help reduce swelling and puffiness with anti- inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

                          Coffea Arabica Seed Oil: A non-fragrant plant oil that helps skin bolster its moisture retention.

                          Trehalose: This water-binding plant sugar acts as a humectant, drawing hydration to skin to support moisture retention.

                          Red 633nm and near-infrared 830nm are the most clinically-proven wavelengths for skin health and rejuvenation, with 830nm achieving the quickest results and client satisfaction.
                          Shorter wavelengths such as green, yellow and purple penetrate poorly and are absorbed by melanin and superficial blood. They will not reach the dermis where the main cells for healing and rejuvenation are located, and therefore will not stimulate the production of collagen and elastin.
                          Longer wavelengths such as red 633nm and near-infrared 830nm penetrate well into the skin and reach the dermis – not only do they stimulate collagen and elastin production (rejuvenating the complexion), they also penetrate deep into the body, reaching muscles, nerves and bone, increasing blood flow and targeting inflammation whilst supporting cellular regrowth and regeneration to help reduce pain and heal injuries."

                          Red 633nm and near-infrared 830nm are the most clinically-proven wavelengths for skin health and rejuvenation, with 830nm achieving the quickest results and client satisfaction.
                          Shorter wavelengths such as green, yellow and purple penetrate poorly and are absorbed by melanin and superficial blood. They will not reach the dermis where the main cells for healing and rejuvenation are located, and therefore will not stimulate the production of collagen and elastin.
                          Longer wavelengths such as red 633nm and near-infrared 830nm penetrate well into the skin and reach the dermis – not only do they stimulate collagen and elastin production (rejuvenating the complexion), they also penetrate deep into the body, reaching muscles, nerves and bone, increasing blood flow and targeting inflammation whilst supporting cellular regrowth and regeneration to help reduce pain and heal injuries."
